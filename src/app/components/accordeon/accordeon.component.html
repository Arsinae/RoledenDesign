      <div class="panelTitle" title>House Atr√©ides</div>
      One of the Great Houses of the feudal interstellar empire known as the Padishah Empire (often referred to as the Imperium),
      its members play a role in every novel in the series. It is suggested within the series that the root of the Atreides line is
      the mythological Greek House of Atreus. In Homer's Iliad, the brothers Agamemnon and Menelaus are dubbed "the Atreides", meaning
      "the sons of Atreus".
